## Description
The project contains the implementation of a Dijkstra path planning algorithm for a Rigid and Point Robot in a space with obstacles. Our approach uses a priority queue for exploring nodes and half-plane equations for defining the obstacles. The exploration and plath is shown in the form of a pygame animation of the solution path is found

## Dependencies
1. Ubuntu 16.04 or Windows
2. Python 3.7 and above
3. pygame
```
pip install pygame
```

## Output Time
  18 mins
  
## Run
1. To Run Dijkstra for point Robot
```
python Dijkstra_Point_Robot.py
```
2. To Run Dijkstra for Rigid Robot
```
python Dijkstra_Rigid_Robot.py
```
## Output
1.Dijkstra Rigid Robot
